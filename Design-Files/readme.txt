This directory should be kept up to date.
Keep here all the files you create and you are working on.

This is project main work directory. Keep here the schematic and board files of the project which has not been finished yet or which you are working on.
Once this board was released, UPDATE THE SCHEMATIC AND PROJECT VERSION, and keep notes about any required or future changes in the TODO directory.
